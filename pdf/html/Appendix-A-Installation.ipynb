    "This book is written in Jupyter Notebook, a browser based interactive Python environment that mixes Python, text, and math. I choose it because of the interactive features - I found Kalman filtering nearly impossible to learn until I started working in an interactive environment. It is difficult to form an intuition about many of the parameters until you can change them and immediately see the output. An interactive environment also allows you to play 'what if' scenarios. \"What if I set $\\mathbf{Q}$ to zero?\" It is trivial to find out with Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason I choose it is because most textbooks leaves many things opaque. For example, there might be a beautiful plot next to some pseudocode. That plot was produced by software, but software that is not available to the reader. I want everything that went into producing this book to be available to you. How do you plot a covariance ellipse? You won't know if you read most books. With Jupyter Notebook all you have to do is look at the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you choose to read the book online you will want Python and the SciPy stack installed so that you can write your own Kalman filters. There are many different ways to install these libraries, and I cannot cover them all, but I will cover a few typical scenarios."
